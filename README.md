TASK 1:
1.Create an inner function to calculate the addition in the following way
•	Create an outer function that will accept two parameters ‘a’ and ‘b’ 
•	Create an inner function inside an outer function that will calculate the addition of ‘a’ and ‘b’ 
•	At last, an outer function will add 5 into addition and return it
2. Given input String of combination of the lower and upper case ,arrange characters in such a way that all lowercase letters should come first.
3.Given a Python list, remove all the even number from the list and save those even number in another list and print both the lists.
For a given input list:  List1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output : List1=[1,3,5,7]
	List2 = [2,4,6]
4.Get the key corresponding to the minimum value from the following dictionary using appropriate python logic.
sample={
‘physics’, 88 ,  ‘maths’, 75,  ’chemistry’ , 72,’Basic electrical’ , 89 
}
5.  Given two Python sets, update first set with items that exist only in the first set and not in the second set .
S1={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
S2={1,3,4,6,8,11,22,34,51,67}
6.Program to create simple calculator in Python which on input of 1,2,3,4 should add , subtract , multiply and divide respectively.


***[DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects. It is generally the most commonly used pandas object.]***


PANDAS:
This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. It's a great dataset for beginners learning to work with data analysis and visualization.
Download the data set and solve the following:
Source :https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds

7. Write a Pandas program to read a csv file from a specified source and print the first 5 rows
8. Write a Pandas program to select a series from diamonds DataFrame. Print the content of the series.
9. Write a Pandas program to calculate count, minimum, maximum price for each cut of diamonds DataFrame.
10.Write a Pandas program to check the number of rows and columns and drop those row if 'any' values are missing in a row of diamonds DataFrame.
11.  Write a Pandas program to count the duplicate rows of diamonds DataFrame.
12. Write a Pandas program to get sample 75% of the diamonds DataFrame's rows without replacement and store the remaining 25% of the rows in another DataFrame
